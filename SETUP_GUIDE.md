# üöÄ Investment Tracker - Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Spreadsheet ID Configuration

Since this is a **standalone script** (not bound to a specific sheet), you **MUST** configure your spreadsheet ID.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Spreadsheet ID

1. Open your Google Sheet with investment data
2. Look at the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SPREADSHEET_ID]/edit
   ```
3. Copy the **SPREADSHEET_ID** part

**Example:**
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abc123XYZ456-your-id-here/edit
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                      This is your SPREADSHEET_ID
```

---

### Step 2: Add Spreadsheet ID to Script

**Option A: Edit Locally (Recommended)**

1. Open `invest.gs` in your editor:
   ```bash
   cd ~/repo/investment-tracker
   code invest.gs
   ```

2. Find the CONFIG section (around line 29):
   ```javascript
   var CONFIG = {
     EMAIL_TO: 'yusufajarmoekti@gmail.com',
     SPREADSHEET_ID: '', // REQUIRED: Add your Google Sheets ID here!
   ```

3. Paste your spreadsheet ID:
   ```javascript
   SPREADSHEET_ID: '1abc123XYZ456-your-id-here',
   ```

4. Push changes:
   ```bash
   clasp push
   ```

**Option B: Edit in Browser**

1. Open the script:
   ```bash
   clasp open-script
   ```

2. Find the CONFIG section and add your SPREADSHEET_ID

3. Click Save (üíæ)

### Step 4: Set Up Triggers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getSheetByName')"

**Cause**: SPREADSHEET_ID not configured

**Fix**: Add your spreadsheet ID to CONFIG as shown in Step 2

---

### Error: "Spreadsheet not found"

**Cause**: Wrong spreadsheet ID or no access

**Fix**:
1. Double-check the spreadsheet ID
2. Make sure you have access to the spreadsheet
3. Make sure you're logged in with the correct Google account

---

### Error: "Sheet 'Sheet1' not found"

**Cause**: Sheet name doesn't match CONFIG.SHEET_NAME

**Fix**: Update CONFIG.SHEET_NAME to match your actual sheet name:
```javascript
SHEET_NAME: 'Your Actual Sheet Name',
```

---

### No email received

**Cause**: Email address not configured or script not authorized

**Fix**:
1. Check CONFIG.EMAIL_TO is correct
2. Run `verifySetup()` to authorize
3. Check spam folder
4. Check Apps Script execution log for errors

---

### Dropdown not working after auto-timestamp

**Cause**: Reference row (row 2) doesn't have dropdown

**Fix**: Make sure row 2 of your spreadsheet has the dropdown validation in column E
